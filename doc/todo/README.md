# VendorPro Task Management

This directory contains the task breakdown for the VendorPro application development following Scrum methodology.

## Task Organization

Tasks are organized into the following structure:
- Each task is designed to be completed in 4-5 hours
- Tasks are grouped by sprints (2-week iterations)
- Each task has a unique ID, description, acceptance criteria, and status
- Priority is indicated as: High (P0), Medium (P1), Low (P2)

## Task Status Tracking

Each task can have one of the following statuses:
- `TODO`: Not yet started
- `IN_PROGRESS`: Currently being worked on
- `REVIEW`: Completed but pending review
- `DONE`: Completed and accepted

## How to Use

1. Start with Sprint 1 tasks
2. Move tasks from TODO to IN_PROGRESS when starting work
3. Update task status to REVIEW when completed
4. After review, update to DONE

## Task Files

- `sprint-backlog.md`: Contains the product backlog and prioritized tasks
- `sprint-1.md`: Tasks for the first sprint
- `sprint-2.md`: Tasks for the second sprint
- And so on...

## Updating Task Status

To mark a task as complete, change its status in the corresponding sprint file:

```markdown
- [x] TASK-001: Create project structure
```

For tasks in progress:

```markdown
- [ ] TASK-002: Set up authentication service
```
